# OS_Assignment
This repository contains the solutions for an Operating Systems (OS) assignment. The assignment includes both practical programming tasks and theoretical questions. 
Below are the details of the assignment and its solutions.

# Question 1:
a) Find out the Linux kernel version of your system using the command on the terminal.

b) Find out the distribution name and version of your operating system using the command on the terminal. 

# Question 2:
a) Write a C program (named: mywrite.c), which will open a new text file (myFile.txt) in the write mode. Using the C standard library API, your program should take the following information from the user in the terminal window:
Name, Age (type integer), Height (in Feet, type float).
Next, it should write the above information to the myFile.txt.

b) Write another C program (myread.c), which will open an already existing file (myFile.txt obtained from the above program) in read mode. Using the C standard library API, your program will read the information in the myFile.txt and print it to the terminal window.

# Questions 3:
What does POSIX stand for? Write a short description of POSIX.

# Questions 4:
Various Operating systems use various structures such as Monolithic, Layered or Microkernel. Give at least five examples of operating systems for each of the structure.

Monolithic Structure: Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400, z/TPF, BSD, SunOS, AIX, and MULTICS

Layered Approach Structure: CP/M and DOS

Micro-kernel Structure: QNX, Symbian, L4Linux, Singularity, K42, Mac OS X, Integrity, PikeOS, HURD, Minix, and Coyotos.

Client-Server Model: DNS (Domain Name Systems), web browsers and web servers, and FTP (file transfer protocol) clients.
